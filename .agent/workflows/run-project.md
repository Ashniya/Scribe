To run the Scribe project, follow these steps:

### 1. Run the Backend
Open a terminal and navigate to the `backend` directory, then start the development server:
```powershell
cd backend
npm run dev
```
The backend will start on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

### 2. Run the Frontend
Open a **second** terminal and navigate to the `frontend` directory, then start the Vite development server:
```powershell
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
The frontend will start on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

**Note:** I have already started both servers for you in the background!
- **Backend**: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
- **Frontend**: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
